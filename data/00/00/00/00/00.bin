  |   Alongside today's DLC, Power Rangers: Battle For The Grid has         |
  |   received a new 1.3 update that introduces several previously          |
  |   unreleased features. The full rundown is as follows                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The v1.3 update vastly improves the game's social play and          |
  |     matchmaking, including Direct Match, which lets friends or any      |
  |     two specific players match up against each other                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The game now also enables crossplay between Nintendo Switch and     |
  |     Xbox One, where players across the two gaming platforms can         |
  |     battle against each other in Ranked, Casual, or Direct Matches      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Crossplay helps players find matches faster against similarly       |
  |     skilled players and opens up a larger matchmaking pool, making      |
  |     the game more competitive                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Crossplay is enabled by nWayPlay, nWay's recently announced game    |
  |     development platform, which offers a player ID and social system,   |
  |     allowing friends to find each other across platforms                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * NWayPlay also enables cross-progression between Nintendo Switch     |
  |     and Xbox One, so players can carry progress made on one platform    |
  |     to another                                                          |
